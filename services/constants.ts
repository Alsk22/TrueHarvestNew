The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending

Worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I’ll worship Your holy name`,

Count your blessings, see what God hath done!
Count your blessings, name them one by one,

Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
And you will keep singing as the days go by.

(Refrain)

When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings. Wealth can never buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.

(Refrain)

So, amid the conflict whether great or small,
Do not be disheartened, God is over all;
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.
